    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 border-b pb-2">League History (2013-Present)</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700">The TFFL has been a vibrant and evolving fantasy football league since its inception in 2013, with competitors spanning four different states (California, Oregon, Washington, and Colorado) and even two different continents for a short period of time (Bill & Kathy Kuhl participating from Singapore), showcasing the league's incredible geographical reach. Starting with just eight teams, it expanded to 10 in 2014 and reached its current competitive format of 12 teams in 2015. Over the years, the league has continuously adapted its rules to stay fun and competitive, moving from a 2-QB format to a single QB, introducing PPR scoring, adding IDPs, and implementing keepers, with the most recent evolution being the removal of kickers in 2024. The move from ESPN to the Sleeper app in 2019 marked a new era, on brand with the league’s quest to stay ahead of the curve. The league's history is a rich tapestry of camaraderie, fierce rivalries, and unique traditions—from poster board drafts and party-sized burritos to contentious trades and historic father-son matchups—all defining a legacy built by its dedicated owners.</p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700"><strong>2013</strong><br>The inaugural season of the TFFL began with just eight teams. The core of today's league was established then with five inaugural members who are still active: Stephen Zamora, Ron Wilson, Taylor Wilson, Riley Kuhl, and Bill Kuhl. Nate Honnes, Eric Talmich, and Kary Dodson also competed in this first season, with Eric and Kary only competing for that inaugural year. 6 of the 8 members all worked together at the North Santa Ana Home Depot! The very first draft was a foundational moment, with all eight owners gathered around a dining room table, using a poster board and Sharpies to write down their picks. The league's format was unique, allowing for 2 QBs on each roster. The camaraderie was fueled by a SuperMex party-sized wet carnitas burrito, which was finished by the end of the night. Stephen Zamora's Team Zbaggs won the first championship with an 8-5 record. Despite Stephen's championship, Ron Wilson's Somewhere Over Dwayne Bowe had the best regular season record at 11-2, but ultimately finished second in the playoffs. </p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700"><strong>2014</strong><br>The league expanded to 10 teams in 2014 (two divisions of five teams) and upgraded its draft experience from a simple poster board to a more legit draft board with player stickers. This year saw the departure of inaugural members Eric Talmich and Kary Dodson, while new competitors Mitch Sennewald, Jason Zamora, Israel Flores, Peter Flores, and Richard Diaz joined the league. Inaugural owner Bill Kuhl also did not compete this season as his family settled overseas. With the expansion, the roster settings changed to one QB, much to the dismay of Stephen Zamora, who hasn't let that go since. This season saw Richard Diaz's Team Diaz win the championship with a 10-3 record, but it was not without controversy. Richard showed up late to the draft, and a friend drafted the core of his team before he even arrived, creating unrest in the league. The season was also plagued with chaos involving unfair trades where playoff teams loaded up on talent for very little return, similar to the frequent "Collusion!" storylines of the FX show "The League." Despite the chaos, Israel Flores's team, It's Tank, had a strong showing, finishing 3rd with an 8-5 record.</p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700"><strong>2015</strong><br>The league expanded again in 2015, reaching its current competitive format of 12 teams (two divisions of six teams). In this year, Taryn Wilson was introduced to the league as the first solo female owner. Learning from the chaos of the previous season, the league created a much more strict system of rules for trades and introduced PPR (Points Per Reception) scoring. This year also saw the addition of Jake Wolfer and Jose Granados, as founding member Nate Honnes and second-year member Peter Flores departed the league. This year also saw the return of inaugural owner Bill Kuhl. That year, Mitch Sennewald's Lambo's Fields finished with a dominant 10-3 record and secured his first championship after defeating Israel Flores's It's Tank in the final.</p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700"><strong>2016</strong><br>The 2016 season was a historic one, as it featured the inaugural TFFL trophy, which was designed and built by Taylor Wilson himself. This season, the league went away from the traditional two division structure and ensured that the top 6 teams made the playoffs and the league would use his format for several years after this. The championship of 2016 was a historic matchup known as the "Wilson Bowl," the first and only time a father and son have faced off in the TFFL final. Ron Wilson's team, Woodhead Be Out Of The Question, bounced back from a rough 2015 season to win his first title. He defeated his son, Taylor Wilson, in the championship, claiming the new trophy. The season was also notable for Jose Granados's team, Qui-Long Quinn, which went an astounding 12-1 in the regular season but finished fourth in the playoffs, a classic case of regular-season dominance not translating to a championship.</p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700"><strong>2017</strong><br>In 2017, the league's draft tradition evolved once again with an upgrade from the sticker-based draft board to a giant projector screen. As fun as the draft was, the post-draft Mario Kart may have been even better. This season also saw a notable change in the ownership of Team Kuhl, as Kathy Kuhl formally joined Bill as a co-owner, after having assisted him with the team for a year or two prior. It was also the year Mitch Sennewald made history by becoming the TFFL's first two-time champion. His team, Bad Hombres, secured the title, etching his name into the record books. He was the first owner to win multiple championships, a feat that would not be replicated until Ron Wilson won his second title in 2019. The championship game was hard-fought, with the top three teams all finishing with an 8-5 record, showcasing the league's competitive balance.</p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700"><strong>2018</strong><br>After a year with the projector, the TFFL draft returned to the trusted sticker-based draft board in 2018 (with a virtual draft board being operated behind the scenes for remote drafters). This year saw a new owner join, Steven Sennewald, while original owner Taryn Wilson teamed up with Richard Diaz on a single team. Another rule update added IDPs (Individual Defensive Players) to the roster format and introduced keepers, allowing owners to retain players from the previous season (at a price), adding a new layer of long-term strategy. Prior to the draft, The Commish designed and ordered custom TFFL shirts for the entire league (at their expense, he’s not wealthy). For former champions, an additional emblem was added to the front of the shirt to acknowledge their past success. Bill & Kathy Kuhl's Team Kuhl claimed their first title, finishing with a league-best 10-3 record. This championship marked the end of the league's time on ESPN. Taylor Wilson's The Zeke-a Virus also had a strong season, finishing 2nd with an impressive 11-2 record, though his loss in the final meant his championship record moved to 0-2.</p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700"><strong>2019</strong><br>The 2019 season marked a new era with the league making a forward-thinking move to the Sleeper app. An upgraded TFFL trophy, dubbed The Golden Throne due to its toilet-shaped topper, was also created to replace the inaugural trophy. This year saw the departure of Taryn Wilson and Richard Diaz, who left the league to focus on their newborn, and new owner Zach Loya took over their team. In addition, this was also the last season that the live draft parties were a full in-person event, taking place as a backyard draft at the Sennewald House where owners used personal devices to draft with the results shown on a television. With the move to Sleeper and the additional league customization options it offered, the league also began to utilize a different system for tracking wins and losses. In addition to the traditional head to head matchup, owners also began battling to finish in the top 6 scorers for the week to earn an additional point in the win column (League Median). Ron Wilson's Ooops i did it again!!! went 18-8 on the way to his second championship. Mitch Sennewald's Nuk Hurricanes finished 2nd with a 15-11 record, falling just short of becoming the first three-time champion.</p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700"><strong>2020</strong><br>After an experimental season where League Median wins counted towards the overall win-loss record, the league course-corrected a little to re-prioritize head to head wins. The first piece of this was to re-align the league into three divisions of four teams: The Defenders, The Contenders, and The Pretenders (leaning heavily on an Avengers theme at the height of the Infinity War Saga), with the top four teams from the previous season making up the top division and then the middle four and bottom four making up the rest. The division standings were based solely on head to head records with the League Median system only being utilized to create a new Wild Card system. This new Wild Card system prioritized the top three teams based on a combination of head to head record and performance against the League Median. This system allowed head to head records to remain the most prominent decider in who made the playoffs while the Wild Card system ensured that the best three remaining teams also made it (limiting the amount of influence that facing a tougher schedule and/or just having bad luck could impact your playoff chances). With the addition of divisions, each owner played each team in their division twice during the season and faced all but one of the remaining teams once. The 2020 season also marked a new kind of draft day tradition as it was the first to feature a live video chat, a necessary pivot due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Commish did his best to put something special together for this draft despite the challenging times and prepared draft day care packages for every team in the league, including: league-branded stickers, koozies, hand sanitizer, and an ice-cold beer (that just needed refrigerating). This was also the year that the league moved to a division-based league format. Taylor Wilson's Glass Case of Emotion had a dominant championship season, finishing with a 21-5 record. Jose Granados' Papa Stan finished 3rd with a 17-9 record. This season highlighted Taylor's consistency, and he now holds the league's leading career win percentage.</p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700"><strong>2021</strong><br>In 2021, the NFL expanded their regular season to 17 games. This additional game was a perfect addition to the league standings system that was established in the previous year. That additional game meant that each owner would face every team in their division twice while playing every other team in the league once (which perfectly satisfied the OCD of The Commish). The Pretenders division was the highlight of this season, with three teams finishing with a 9-5 record or better, including: Stephen Zamora's Eks Marks The Spot, Jake Wolfer's Dey Drinking, and Israel Flores’s Tank 5657. Despite their regular season dominance, none of those teams made it to the final. Bill & Kathy Kuhl secured their second championship, this time over Riley Kuhl, their nephew. They became the third team in the league to become a repeat champion!</p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700"><strong>2022</strong><br>While the live draft parties had already become a thing of the past for the TFFL, the video chat draft lobbies became a necessity with The Commish moving to Washington over the offseason. While the idea of a live draft party hosted at the bluest house in all of the PNW was floated around, it never came to fruition. However, this was the first season in many years where Mitch was able to sit next to The Commish and steal players during the draft while in the same room. The 2022 season was the first time in several years where the championship game would guarantee a first time TFFL champion! After falling short in the championship a couple years prior, Jason Zamora secured his first title with a stellar performance from Henry Given Sunday, just edging out regular season champ Jake Wolfer’s Dey Drinking in the big game. Following another rough year, Steven Sennewald decided to ride off into the sunset, thus concluding his time in the TFFL for now.</p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700"><strong>2023</strong><br>The 2023 season saw the return of a key competitor. After a four-year absence from the league, Taryn Wilson reclaimed the team that she once gave up to allow Steven Sennewald to join the league. This season also included another fun rule change, introducing the concept of Free Agent Acquisition Budgets (FAAB) to the waiver claim process. This brought a whole new level of chaos to waiver wire days, giving every team the ability to add anyone they wanted as long as they were the highest bidder. Ron Wilson won his third championship with Dewey DewHickeys, despite a rocky regular season where he needed the League Median wins to help him secure a playoff spot. He defeated Riley Kuhl's Ludgate's Squad in the final, a team that had the second best regular season record at 10-4. This championship solidified Ron as the all-time leader in TFFL championships.</p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700"><strong>2024</strong><br>This season marked the formation of a new co-owner duo as Josh Sanchez officially joined forces with Taryn to form the team Amon the Run. Josh had begun to assist Taryn with her team in the previous season, but jumped fully on board in the summer leading up to their engagement. Also, TFFL finally gave Kickers the boot (get it?), which was probably long overdue. In a major turnaround, Zach Loya's We Stink went from finishing 11th the previous year to winning the championship, following a 10-4 regular season. This was the first strong showing from Zach since joining the league and one of the biggest worst to first stories the league has ever seen. As far as league records can prove, this was the first team in TFFL history to start the season with the first overall pick that ended in a championship. Taylor Wilson's WA Whatchamacallits also had a strong season, finishing 2nd with a 11-3 regular season record before the Commissioner's Curse bit him again.</p>
